This converter is written entirely in JavaScript and runs completely in the browser. Once the page finishes loading, there are no subsequent calls to the server. Because of this, there’s no risk of data breach. Other converters written in server-side languages, which usually submit input and output text using plain HTTP instead of HTTPS, transmitting your data in the clear as plain, unencrypted text, expose you and your data to unnecessary risk. While these server-side converters are good exercises in programming, and may be useful in a trusted intranet setting, they should not be used if they are hosted by untrusted third parties on the unsecured Web.

Conversion of the CSV input text to JavaScript objects is handled by code written by me. Conversion of the JavaScript objects to JSON output text is handled by Douglas Crockford’s public domain JSON JavaScript library.
